# LatAm Lingo.edu
Latin America Language and Culture School

LatAm Lingo is school of Latin American indigenous languages and cultures which seeks to educate their students with language and cultural skills for effective communication across Latin America.

The school founders are a group of indigenous and mestizaje friends who met at university and shared the same dismay about how little their classmates (and society in general) knew about the LatAm indigenous population. Beyond the professional desire for a profitable business is their societal goal of education and awareness about their native heritage. The government and NGO heritage organisations partially fund the start-up.

## Visual Design
### Wireframes
[Wireframes History](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MC90lZssd6aURDya1wHe3fbtSQ6kODsg?usp=share_link)

### Icons
- Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Free Icon library.
- Icons are utilised in the footer for social account icons and the "more below" arrow on the gallery page.

### Content

#### Fonts
Both fonts are downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
-Headings: Eczar, Medium 500
-Body: Merriweather, Regular 400

#### Colors
Color base was chosen from a deep purple on in hero image using eyedropper.org. Purple is generally associated with education and the various shades generated by colormind.io provided a range of options. I then used color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel to find complementary and contrasting colors. The final selection was chosen using contrast-grid.eightshapes.com for WCAG 2.0 contrast grading as shown below: 
- #FFB1E5 (light purple) - text even, h/r text
- #0F0C30 (dark purple) - text odd, background even, h/f background
- #F1F0FB (very light purple) - background odd
- #FFFF00 (yellow) - text on hero with black shadow effect to add contrast

### Images
- The images are a mixure of places, personalities and events chosen to evoke feelings of engagement, curiosity and adventure about native Latin America. All made more accessible with knowledge of the indigenous languages and cultures.

### Styling
The overall approach that I took to styling was clarity and consistancy. This included:
- Limited set of fonts and colors
-- High contrast on alternating pages
-- Distinct header and footer color schemes
-- Consistent use of page element styling

This approach carries over to the coding where the styling is organised for use.

# Features
## Scrollable single page
This site presents the user with a single page allowing giving them the option of:
- Scrolling through the site
- Navigating directly to a content section

## Navigation Bar
This feature appears on all pages for consistency and ease of use.
- The navbar is fixed so it is visible no matter how far you scroll.
- The logo provides a link back to the home page at all times
- The Navbar is simple and provides clear access to the primary user goals and site features; Home, About, Gallery, Registration
-- This feature allows the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
- On smaller devices the menu collapses to a drop down "hamburger"
-- Note: I decided to leave the "hamburger" open/close feature to be user enabled as I found it useful for switching between the registration and about when deciding on a selecting a class. Future design would include more choices and information on the registration screen.
